To use this software its all in the bash script. modify the folder you wish to serve, the port the app runs, then its all in the config.sh file. at the top there are a couple variables, only edit the port and folder variable, this folder is the relative path of the folder that the files you wish to share are inside of. if you use a ../ i think it might be able to do parent folders.
